Coding Temple Weekend Project #3
***

This is my third weekend project for Coding Temple. The assignment was to make a rental property ROI (or is it ROR?) calculator program using **object-oriented programming** in  **Python**.

I used a few similar features to last week's food repository program: a "sprint" function to print lines character by character and a "rest" function to make the steps of the program run on a more human scale.

For this project I colored all the text manually using **ANSI escape codes** rather than using a module. I don't think I'll do that again as a general practice but it might still be useful for specifying color and style for specific words or phrases within a string.

Another personal focus for this project was robust error handling and also trying to keep things simple for the user.
